## Creating a new city logo / badge

When creating a new codethecity event it's a good idea to customise your look by adapting the generic badge to refect your own city. The skyline used in the generic badge is that of Aberdeen, Scotland. 

All files are available as both Adobe Illustrator .ai files and the more general .svg. For convenience a number of resized .png files are typically also included.

Tips for getting your badge right:

- Try to stick to a 2 or 3 colour look for cost effective printing
- Try to use vector artwork to allow your badge to scale up nicely
- Keep type and lettering LARGE
- Don't change the locked layers - these ensure that all the badges are consistent, and look great as a set
- Do change anything that's not locked - go to town within the constraints of that outer circle and central bar
- Do save as SVG / PDF / PNG and as many other formats as you like. Make it as easy as possible for someone to pick up your design and adapt it for their city
- Don't feel restricted to skylines - pick a landmark, a mascot, or something else. Just try to keep it simple and iconic.
- All files added to this repo should be released under as permissive a licence as possible.
