# Code The City - Aberdeen 2014 repo

Codethecity is an initiative aiming to improve our cities through highly focussed civic hacking events, bringing coders, designers, community members and service providers together to make a difference.

Our first event happens on 21st/22nd June 2014 in Aberdeen.
